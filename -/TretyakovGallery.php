            <h3> Location: Moscow.</h3>
            <h3> The founder of the museum: Pavel Tretyakov.</h3>
            <h3> Date of foundation: 1856.</h3>
            <h3> The Tretyakov Gallery, as the museum is called in everyday life, has a rich collection and is famous for many ideas and projects that have found their embodiment. That is why the Tretyakov Gallery has become so widely known and attracts the attention of true art connoisseurs from all over the world.</h3>

            <h2> The main objectives of the museum</h2>
            <h3> The Tretyakov Gallery, as one of the most famous cultural institutions in Russia, proclaims four main goals of its activities: to preserve, explore, present and popularize Russian art, thereby forming a national cultural identity and instilling in modern generations an understanding of the important role that art plays as the embodiment of achievements and expression of the civilization of our society.</h2>

            <h3> The main building of the Tretyakov Gallery at 10 Lavrushinsky Lane in Zamoskvorechye used to belong to the founder's family – his parents and himself lived in this house. Subsequently, the merchant's estate was rebuilt several times. The gallery also occupies buildings adjacent to the main building. The facade that we can see today was built at the beginning of the last century, the author of the sketches was V. M. Vasnetsov.</h3>
            <h3> The style of the building is neo–Russian, and this is no coincidence: it was also intended to emphasize the fact that the museum is a repository of samples of Russian art. On the same main facade, visitors can see a bas–relief image of the capital's coat of arms - St. George with a snake. And on both sides of it there is a ceramic polychrome frieze, very elegant. A large lettering with the names of Peter and Sergei Tretyakov, both donors of the collection, is made up of a single whole with the frieze.</h3>

            <h3> In 1930, an additional room was erected to the right of the main building, designed by architect A. Shchusov. The Engineering Building is located to the left of the former merchant estate. In addition, the Tretyakov Gallery owns a complex on Krymsky Val, where, in particular, exhibitions of contemporary art are held. The exhibition hall in Tolmachi, the museum-temple of St. Nicholas, as well as the museum of A.M. Vasnetsov, the house-museum of the national artist P. D. Korin and the museum-workshop of the sculptor A. S. Golubkina also belong to the Tretyakov Gallery.</h3>

            <h3> The modern collection includes more than 170 thousand works of Russian art, and this is far from the limit: it continues to be replenished thanks to artists, donations from individuals, various organizations and heirs of outstanding artists who bring various works as gifts. The exposition is divided into sections, each covering a specific historical period. Let's call them: ancient Russian art, starting from the XII and ending with the XVIII century; painting of the XVII — first half of the XIX centuries; painting of the second half of the XIX century; Russian Russian graphics from the XIII to the XIX centuries, as well as Russian sculpture of the same period.</h3>
