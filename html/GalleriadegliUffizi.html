            <h3> Location: Florence.</h3>
            <h3> The founder of the museum: Francesco I.</h3>
            <h3> Date of foundation: 1581.</h3>
            <h3> The collections of the Uffizi Gallery are considered to be among the oldest in Europe. To accommodate them, in the XVI century, luxurious palace buildings were built on the banks of the Arno River. The construction of the palaces took more than 20 years, and for this it was necessary to demolish the old city blocks. Two centuries before its official opening, the art collection was widely known, and according to preliminary requests, anyone could inspect the works of art stored here.</h3>

            <h3> In the third lobby there are sarcophagi and statues from the era of Ancient Rome. The environment, consisting of three lobbies, was created at the end of the eighteenth century with the completion of the monumental staircase, a new access to the gallery, at the behest of Grand Duke Pietro Leopoldo.</h3>

            <h3> The third floor of the building is reserved for an art gallery. In addition, the palace houses rare documents on the history of Florence, and you can also see the Cabinet of Drawings and engravings. His unique collection began to take shape in the XVII century, thanks to Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici.</h3>
            <h3>The Uffizi Gallery presents world-famous paintings by Sandro Botticelli: "The Birth of Venus", "Spring", "Madonna and Child with an Angel" and "Slander". Halls 10-14 are dedicated to the work of the Italian painter and a friend of the Medici family.</h3>

            <h3> Hall No. 25 of the Uffizi Gallery presents to visitors the masterpiece of the young Michelangelo Buonarroti "The Holy Family". This is a round painting made in the popular kanjiante technique at that time, when the shapes of human bodies were conveyed with sculptural expressiveness. Part of the gallery's space is devoted to the works of foreign masters of painting. In these halls you can see paintings by Durer, Goya, El Greco, Velasquez, Rubens, Rembrandt and Van Dyck.</h3>

            <h3> About 1,500 paintings are stored in the famous Vasari air corridor. These are self-portraits by Raphael, Rubens, Diego Velazquez, Giorgio Vasari and other artists. Among the Russian painters, self-portraits of Boris Kustodiev, Ivan Aivazovsky, Orest Kiprensky and Viktor Ivanov are exhibited here. The collection of self-portraits is constantly being updated through purchases and donations. All artists regard the opportunity to exhibit their self-portrait in the Uffizi Gallery as a great honor.</h3>

            <h3> Of the sculptures stored in the museum, the statue "Venus de' Medici" deserves special attention. It was created in the 1st century AD by an unknown author. Recently, scientists conducted a study of the sculpture and found out that it used to be painted. The woman's lips were covered with scarlet paint, and her hair was golden. The sculpture on display in Florence is a copy of the famous statue of the ancient Greek sculptor Praxiteles, which he created in the IV century BC. She portrayed Aphrodite of Cnidus, and the Athenian hetaera Phryne, known for her beauty, posed for Praxiteles. Pliny called this work of the famous sculptor the most beautiful statue on Earth.</h3>
